  <!-- ! the second you enable a
    ! flex box on a container all of the DirectChild elements become 
    ! what we call flex items  -->
    <div class="parent">
      <div class="item"></div>
      <div class="item"></div>
<!-- ! an element can be both flex item and flex container  at the same times  -->
      <div class="item3">
        <div class="subitem"></div>
        <div class="subitem"></div>
        <div class="subitem"></div>
      </div>

<!-- ! flex box : respect the height and width prop -->
<!--! the main tenet of flexbox and that  is the fact that we have one  dimensional  model where we can align items on even  horizontall or verticall access   -->
<!-- @ there i'll take the notes then i will practice 
@ flex direction  what this prop defining its what we'll use as the main axis and  what we gonna using as  cross axis  
@ if flex direction set to row  so there gonna go horizontal and the main  axis gonna be horizantol 
@ and if flex direction set to column so there gonna go vertical and   the main acess it's gonna be vertical 
@
@justify content : tell us  how the items are spaced out and sligned on !!main!! axis default normal |   gonaa have a width  of inner content 
@align items: tell us how the items are spaced out and aligned on cross axis  by default normal  | is stretch the height of elements  to total height of flex container(cross acces ) unless you have a specific heights set on thsoe elements already 
@
?baselien in align items  you can think we draw a horizontal line kinda  at the bottom of  each piece of content  within in flex iem
